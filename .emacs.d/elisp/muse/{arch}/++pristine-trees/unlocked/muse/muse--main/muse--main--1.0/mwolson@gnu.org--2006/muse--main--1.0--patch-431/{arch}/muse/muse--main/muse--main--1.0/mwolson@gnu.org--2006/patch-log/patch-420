Summary: Really fix termless definition list bug
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Remove unused
  variable.  Track whether a term has been found, and handle that case
  well.
  (muse-publish-ensure-blank-line): Use a marker, so that we don't lose
  our place when adding a newline.  This really fixes the definition list
  item bug.
  (muse-publish-markup-list): Since people do seem to want definition
  lists with no terms, allow this.
