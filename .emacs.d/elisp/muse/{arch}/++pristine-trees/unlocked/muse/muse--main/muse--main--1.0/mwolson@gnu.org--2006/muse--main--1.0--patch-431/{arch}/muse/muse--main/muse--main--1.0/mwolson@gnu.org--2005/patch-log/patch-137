New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-137
Summary: Prevent temp buffers from prompting for save; handle lisp errors better.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-region): Try to fix "Invalid search
  bound" error.  I don't know for certain where this is coming from,
  though ... *grumble*.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-eval-lisp): Wrap this in a `condition-case', much
  like how emacs-wiki does it.  Warn the user about lisp errors,
  returning "<!--INVALID LISP CODE-->" if an error occurs.  This will
  publish as something valid in most markup styles, with increased
  emphasis on those that don't support it.  That's a win-win ... I think
  :^) .

* lisp/muse.el (muse-with-temp-buffer-no-prompt): New macro that acts
  like `with-temp-buffer', but sets buffer-modfied-p to nil before trying
  to kill the buffer so we don't get any annoying prompts.  I *strongly*
  believe that this should be the default behavior of `with-temp-buffer'.

* lisp/muse-book.el (muse-book-publish-project): Use
  `muse-with-temp-buffer-no-prompt'.

* lisp/muse-http.el (muse-http-reject): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-index-as-string): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-poem.el (muse-poem-markup-tag): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-string, muse-publish-file): 
  (muse-publish-markup-email, muse-published-contents): Ditto.
