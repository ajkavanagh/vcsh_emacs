Summary: By default, use ".muse" extension and do not detect by pathname.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-mode-auto-p): Default to nil.
  (muse-file-extension): Default to "muse".  This has the effect of
  making Emacs associate the ".muse" extension with muse-mode, without
  trying to figure things out from the path to the file.  The former
  method is usually considered to be best, so we'll go with it.
