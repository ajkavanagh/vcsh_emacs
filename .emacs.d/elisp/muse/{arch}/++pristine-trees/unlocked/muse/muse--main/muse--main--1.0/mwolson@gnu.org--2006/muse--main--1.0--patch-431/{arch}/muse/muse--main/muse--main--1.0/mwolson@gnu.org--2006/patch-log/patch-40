Summary: Make code look nicer by using muse-forward-dl-* functions.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Factor out lambda
  forms into muse-forward-dl-* for increased reusability.
  (muse-publish-surround-text): Call move function with an indent
  argument so that we don't have to use partial substitution in lambda
  forms.
  (muse-forward-dl-term): New function that moves forward to the next
  definition list term.
  (muse-forward-dl-entry): New function that moves forward to the next
  definition list entry.
  (muse-forward-dl-part): Renamed from `muse-forward-dl-item', since this
  does not move past entire definition list items, only parts of them.
  (muse-publish-markup-list, muse-publish-markup-quote):
  (muse-publish-quote-tag): Use better lambda form, and include a
  parameter.
