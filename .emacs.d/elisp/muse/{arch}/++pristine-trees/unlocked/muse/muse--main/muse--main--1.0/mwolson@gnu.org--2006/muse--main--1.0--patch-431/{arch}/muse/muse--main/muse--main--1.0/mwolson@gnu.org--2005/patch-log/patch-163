Summary: muse-docbook: table and anchor fixes; many non-MULE XEmacs fixes.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-docbook.el: More suggestions from Dale Smith, and non-MULE
  XEmacs fixes.
  (muse-docbook-markup-regexps): Deal with new table algorithm.
  (muse-docbook-transform-content-type, muse-docbook-encoding) 
  (muse-docbook-finalize-buffer): Non-MULE XEmacs fix.
  (muse-docbook-markup-table): Use a better table algorithm, based on the
  one in muse-html.el.  Make sure a <tgroup> surrounds the body, head,
  and foot of the table.  Use informaltable rather than table.
  (muse-docbook-fixup-tables): New function that sorts all tables found
  in the published document so that the order is head, foot, body.
  (muse-docbook-markup-functions): Add anchor handler.
  (muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): Allow anchors to occur at beginning of
  paragraph.
  (muse-docbook-markup-anchor, muse-docbook-insert-anchor): New functions
  that insert an anchor at point.

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-transform-content-type)
  (muse-html-encoding, muse-html-finalize-buffer): Non-MULE XEmacs fixes.

* examples/QuickStart (Anchors and tagged links): Improve anchor example.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-eval-lisp): XEmacs fix.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-with-temp-buffer): XEmacs fix.  Include the body
  that was evaluated in the output.
