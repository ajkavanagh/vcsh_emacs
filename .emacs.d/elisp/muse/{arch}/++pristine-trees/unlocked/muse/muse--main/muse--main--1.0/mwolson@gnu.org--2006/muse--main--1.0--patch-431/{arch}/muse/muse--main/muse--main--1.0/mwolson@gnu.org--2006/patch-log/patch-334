Summary: Fix bug with <contents> and multiple <include> tags
Keywords: 

2007-06-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-insert-contents): Add
	documentation.  Handle case where heading is read-only, but has
	muse-contents property.  Remove the muse-contents property for any
	heading we come across so as to avoid double-including an item in
	an outer table of contents.
	(muse-html-denote-headings): New function that denotes whether a
	heading is not read-only by adding the muse-contents property to
	it.
	(muse-html-munge-buffer): If we are not to generate contents,
	still denote headings, in case some outer layer wants to generate
	contents for our headings.  This should fix a bug with table of
	contents and the <include> tag.  Thanks to thorne for the report.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-region): Let-bind
	muse-publish-generate-contents and set it to nil.  This should
	do the right thing when using <include> tags.
