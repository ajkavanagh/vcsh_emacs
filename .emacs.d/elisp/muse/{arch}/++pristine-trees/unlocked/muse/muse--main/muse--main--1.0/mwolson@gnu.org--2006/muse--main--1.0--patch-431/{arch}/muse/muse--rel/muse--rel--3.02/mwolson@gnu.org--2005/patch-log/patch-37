Summary: Make error messages during publishing more friendly.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-index-as-string): Use with-temp-buffer instead
  of muse-with-temp-buffer since we aren't inserting text from another
  file.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-with-temp-buffer): Note in the documentation that
  this is meant to be used with the insert-file-contents function, in
  order to keep weird side effects from happening.  Make the displayed
  message more friendly when debug-on-error is nil, and suggest what to
  do in order to get a full backtrace.
