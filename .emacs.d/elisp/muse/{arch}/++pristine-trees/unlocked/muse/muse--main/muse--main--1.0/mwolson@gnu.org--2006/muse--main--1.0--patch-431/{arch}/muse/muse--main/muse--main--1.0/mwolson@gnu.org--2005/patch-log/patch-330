Summary: Make progress on non-nested ordered and unordered lists.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-regexps): Make sure that we
  don't match lines with just whitespace for 'quote.
  (muse-publish-markup-comment): Use muse-insert-markup in the correct
  order.  Remove extra comment space.
  (muse-publish-surround-text): Stay at end of line if we are at the end
  of a series of list items.  Otherwise advance.
  (muse-forward-paragraph): Use "\n" instead of "$" in regexps, since the
  former works better in multi-line contexts.
  (muse-forward-list-item): Fix a silly logic error.  Simplify the regexp
  passed to muse-forward-paragraph.  Remove the initial "- " or "1. "
  when the markup types match on a new item.
  (muse-publish-markup-list): Docfix.  Swap args of string-match.  Ignore
  an unordered list if a dash immediately follows.  This disambiguates
  the emdash and unordered list markups.  Use save-excursion to ensure
  that the point ends on the line after the begin-list markup.  We still
  haven't dealt with definition lists yet.
  (muse-publish-markup-quote): Docfix.  Deal with improved regexp.
  Manually remove the leading whitespace.  Insert 'begin-quote and
  'end-quote correctly, and use 'quote-item for
  muse-publish-surround-text.
  (muse-publish-quote-tag): Deal with multiple paragraphs inside of a
  quote tag.  Skip past additional whitespace in the move function for
  muse-publish-surround-text.
  (muse-publish-comment-tag): Make the comment text read-only.
