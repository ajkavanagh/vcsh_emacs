Summary: Fix issue with table of contents and derived html styles.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-finalize-buffer): Since the html style
  does not derive from any other class, return `t' here.  This, along
  with the corresponding change to muse-publish.el, fixes a problem with
  the table of contents getting inserted multiple times for custom
  html-based styles.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-run-hooks): Make sure that we do not
  run the same function twice.
