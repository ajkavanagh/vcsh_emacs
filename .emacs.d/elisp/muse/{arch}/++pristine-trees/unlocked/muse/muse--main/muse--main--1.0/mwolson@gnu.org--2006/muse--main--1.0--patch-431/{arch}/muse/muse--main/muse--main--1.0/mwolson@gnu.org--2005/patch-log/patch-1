Keywords: 

2004-12-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

    * Makefile: Change path to `publish' script.

    * contrib/pcomplete.el: New file that is used by Muse without
    actually being a part of it: hence its location in the contrib
    directory.

    * contrib/cgi.el, contrib/httpd.el: New location.

    * examples/muse-johnw.el, examples/publish-johnw: Ditto.

    * scripts/publish, scripts/publish-project: Ditto.
