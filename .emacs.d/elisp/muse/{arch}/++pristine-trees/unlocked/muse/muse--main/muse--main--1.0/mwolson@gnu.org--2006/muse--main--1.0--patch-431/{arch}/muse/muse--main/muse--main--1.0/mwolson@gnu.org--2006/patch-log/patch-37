Summary: Fix #5376: Changing muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp does not seem to affect anything.
Keywords: 

* muse.texi (Implicit Links): Mention how to customize the WikiName
  recognition, and note that if you're setting this manually, you have to
  call some additional code.  This should fix #5376.  Also remove local
  variables section at end, since it seems pointless.
