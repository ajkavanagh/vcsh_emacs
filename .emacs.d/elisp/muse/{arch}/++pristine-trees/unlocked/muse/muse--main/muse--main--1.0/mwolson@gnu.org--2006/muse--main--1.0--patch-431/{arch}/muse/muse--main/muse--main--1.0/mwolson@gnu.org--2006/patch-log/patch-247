	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-markup-strings): Make an ordered
	list embedded in a definition list look right.  This also allows
	for definitions to be separated from their terms, much like the
	way HTML does it by default, if the user puts a blank line or a
	line break between the term and the definition.  If the term and
	definition are on the same line, they will be that way in the
	output as well.
