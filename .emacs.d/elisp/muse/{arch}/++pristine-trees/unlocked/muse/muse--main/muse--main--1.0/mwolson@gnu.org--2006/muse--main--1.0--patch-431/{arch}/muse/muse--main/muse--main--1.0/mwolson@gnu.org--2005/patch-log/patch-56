New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-56
Summary: Provide optional outline-style faces; customization fixes; experimental stuff.
Keywords: 

* muse-colors.el (muse-colors-autogen-headings): New user-customizable
  option that determines what the header faces should look like.  If
  'outline, use outline-style faces.  If nil, don't generate the faces at
  all, which allows the user to specify their own.  Otherwise, use the
  scaled faces, which is the default behavior.
  (muse-colors-outline-faces-list): List of faces to use.  In case the
  outline faces are not available, provide reasonable defaults.
  (muse-make-faces): Use dolist instead of mapc.  Implement the
  possibility of having outline-style colors for heading.  Don't call
  this function immediately -- give the users time to make their changes
  through the customize interface.  Once we call this function, Emcs from
  CVS will not allow the faces to be changed easily, which is a shame.

* muse-message.el (muse-message-contents-tag): Copied from
  `muse-publish-contents-tag' in order to keep the customization
  interface from making the `muse-markup-tags' option from throwing a
  type mismatch error.  This function is untested and will likely do
  nothing useful.  This file has been moved to the experimental folder
  until it gets fleshed out more.

* experimental/muse-wiki.el: New file from johnw's initial attempt at a
  file that could eventually provide wiki-like ability.  Currently this
  is just a collection of functions that were pruned out when he remade
  Muse, so don't get too excited.  I plan to eventually merge Yann
  Hodique's work here, probably after the first release of Muse.

* muse-regexps.el (muse-regexp): Improve description.

* muse-project.el (muse-project-ignore-regexp): Make this be a part of
  the muse-regexp group since it is just a single regexp.  Lists of
  regexps don't have to be in muse-regexp, however.

* muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom): Change use of `behaviour' to `behavior'
  since the Emacs devel mailing list seems to not want Britain-izations
  in Emacs code.

* muse-colors.el (muse-colors): Ditto.

* muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook): Ditto.

* muse-html.el (muse-html): Ditto.

* muse-http.el (muse-http): Ditto.

* muse-message.el (muse-message): Ditto.

* muse-mode.el (muse-mode): Ditto.

* muse-project.el (muse-project): Ditto.

* muse-publish.el (muse-publish): Ditto.

* muse.el (muse): Ditto.
