Summary: cgi.el: Make this work without cl-seq.el.
Keywords: 

* contrib/cgi.el: Fix a compiler warning introduced by sample calendar
  code.  Make this not depend on 'cl at runtime.
  (cgi-position): New function that implements a simple replacement for
  the position function found in cl-seq.el.
  (cgi-decode): Use `cgi-position' instead of `position' and `substring'
  instead of `subseq'.

* contrib/httpd.el: Credit myself.
