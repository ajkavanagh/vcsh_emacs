Summary: Implement conditional deletion of text in <literal> and <markup> tags
Keywords: 

2007-04-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-table-attributes): Fix typo in
	docstring.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tags): Handle
	<literal> tags with muse-publish-literal-tag, rather than
	muse-publish-mark-read-only.
	(muse-publish-literal-tag): New function that publishes the
	<literal> tag.  It adds the ability to add the optional "style"
	and "exact" elements, which cause text to only be included if the
	current publishing style matches some criteria.  The text will be
	removed otherwise.  Thanks to Jim Ottaway for the implementation.
	(muse-publish-mark-up-tag): Let the <markup> tag take the
	additional optional elements "style" and "exact", with much the
	same effect as the <literal> improvements, but after calling
	"function" or publishing the region first.  Make it possible to
	put <content> tags in <markup> regions in HTML publishing.
