Summary: Make links to files in subdirectories work.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-alist-styles): Fix stray comment.
  (muse-project-page-file): Change to a defun.  Handle files with the
  same name but in different directories.  Handle case where a
  subdirectory is given in a link.
  (muse-project-choose-style-by-link-suffix): Move from muse-wiki.el.
  (muse-project-applicable-styles): Sort entries according to how late in
  the string the match for the include regexp occurs.
  (muse-project-resolve-link): Moved from muse-wiki.el.  Strip
  subdirectory from page because we have already determined the correct
  path.
  (muse-project-link-page): New function that resolves a link to a page
  in the same project.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-link-page): Simple wrapper for
  muse-project-link-page.
  (muse-publish-classify-url): Use muse-publish-link-page.

* lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-file-regexp): Don't match subdirectory
  links.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-choose-style-by-link-suffix)
  (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page-1): Move to muse-project.el.
  (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): Use muse-project-resolve-link.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-collect-alist): New function that is like assoc, but
  returns a list of matches.
  (muse-sort-with-closure): New convenience macro for using `sort' with a
  closure argument.
  (muse-sort-by-rating): New function that takes a rating list and sorts
  it, discarding the rating.

* muse.texi (Projects): Mention that you can use regexps in place of
  directory names in project entries.  Caught that when source-diving.
