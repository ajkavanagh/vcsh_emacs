New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-91
Summary: Work on getting to the point where we can resolve project interwiki links.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-markup-date-directive): Use
  `muse-publishing-current-file'.

* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-of-file): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-applicable-styles): New function
  that returns the usable styles for a file, given either a list of
  styles or a project name.  This is useful for removing styles that will
  be ignored for a file.
  (muse-project-publish-file): Split :include and :exclude processing
  into `muse-project-applicable-styles'.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-output-name): Use
  `muse-publishing-current-file'.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-file): Don't set `muse-current-file'.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Recognize
  project names.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-transform-wikiword): Don't cause project
  names to be uninterpreted.  Remove need for muse-assoc-string.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): First draft of
  function that will be called to fetch a link to a page from a Muse
  project from the output file of the currently-published file.  This is
  commented out for now since I ran out of energy.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-handle-interwiki): Use
  `muse-wiki-resolve-project-page' for handling Muse project interwiki
  links, but only when no match was found in `muse-wiki-interwiki-alist'.
  Handle case where no interwiki can be found, even though this should
  never happen.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-mode-hook): Update `muse-wiki-interwiki-regexp'
  whenever Muse mode is entered.  That way we don't have to enter an
  extra command in our .emacs.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-current-file): Remove this, since a variable called
  `muse-publishing-current-file' already exists that does the same thing.
  How embarrassing.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-page-name): Use `muse-publishing-current-file'.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-assoc-string): Remove this, since we no longer need
  to use it.
