New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-66
Summary: Cater even more to XEmacs and its annoying whims.
Keywords: 

* examples/Makefile (%.html, %.pdf, %.info): Pass EMACS value as
  environment variable.

* lisp/Makefile (%.elc, test): Don't use "-L" option since XEmacs can't
  handle it.  Load `muse-build.el' instead.

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-link): Add note that `link' is not
  used.

* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-latex-munge-buffer)
  (muse-journal-rss-munge-buffer): Add note that the `qotd' binding is
  not used.

* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-generate-pages): Add note that this
  function does not appear to be used.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-replace-regexp-in-string): Use in place of
  `replace-regexp-in-string', since XEmacs doesn't have this function.
  We only implement the first 3 args, but this could be extended if we
  need to do so.

* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-title-to-file): Use
  `muse-replace-regexp-in-string' in place of `replace-regexp-in-string'

* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-anchorize-title): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-custom-tags): Remove unused binding to
  make XEmacs shut up.

* lisp/muse-convert.el (muse-write-footnote): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-table): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-http.el (muse-winnow-list): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-poem.el (muse-poem-markup-tag): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-file-entries): Ditto.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup): Ditto.

* scripts/muse-build.el: Add contrib path first; probably doesn't change
  anything.

* scripts/publish: Use EMACS environment variable instead of hard-coding
  it.
