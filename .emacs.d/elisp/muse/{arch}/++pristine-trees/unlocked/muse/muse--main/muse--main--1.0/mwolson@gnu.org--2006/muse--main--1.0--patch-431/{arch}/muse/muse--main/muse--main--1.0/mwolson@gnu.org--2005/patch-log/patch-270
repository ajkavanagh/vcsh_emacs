Summary: muse-groff: Provide groff-pdf style rather than pdf.
Keywords: 

* experimental/muse-groff.el: Remove, since the original author keeps his
  version in the lisp/ directory, and it's reasonably stable by now.

* lisp/muse-groff.el: Detabify source.
  ("groff-pdf"): Rename the "pdf" publishing style to "groff-pdf" to
  avoid a conflict with the latex-based pdf style.
