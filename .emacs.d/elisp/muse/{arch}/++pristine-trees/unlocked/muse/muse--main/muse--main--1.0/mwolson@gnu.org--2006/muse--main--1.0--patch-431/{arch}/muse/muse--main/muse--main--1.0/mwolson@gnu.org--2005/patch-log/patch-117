Summary: Fix image-link goof-up and add pretty titles.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-paragraph): Use <p
  class="image-link"> instead of <div class="image-link">.  I found a bug
  with the way I was handling both, so I decided to simplify things.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-output-name): New function that acts like
  `muse-publish-output-name', but keeps the directory prefix.
  (muse-wiki-transform-interwiki): Use `muse-publish-output-name'.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-publish-small-title-words): New
  customizable option that determines the words to downcase in title.
  (muse-wiki-publish-pretty-title): New function that Makes a Nicely
  Capitalized Title out of either a string or the current title.  This is
  not currently used by any other function -- for now it is meant to be
  called by the user.
