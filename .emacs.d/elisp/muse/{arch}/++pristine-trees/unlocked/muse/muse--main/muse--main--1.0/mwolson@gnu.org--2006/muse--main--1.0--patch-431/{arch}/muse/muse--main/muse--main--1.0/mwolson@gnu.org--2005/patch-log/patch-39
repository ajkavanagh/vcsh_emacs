Summary: Fix newly-introduced lock-up during HTML publishing.
Keywords: 

* muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-markup-regexps): Give date directive and
  planner rules higher priority in the publishing sequence.  Hopefully
  this will not wreck anything; I don't use these rules, so I cannot
  tell.  This wasn't a real bugfix, just an aesthetic code thing for me.

* muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-paragraph-close): Don't use
  replace-match; that seems to be slightly evil.  Return nil instead of a
  newline since otherwise Muse thinks that we are not done yet and gets
  into an infinite loop.  This should fix the lock-up problem that
  resulted from the previous few patches.
