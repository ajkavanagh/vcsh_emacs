Summary: Fix links in table, links in verbatim, emphasis publishing, publishing from script.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-emphasized): Fix an edge case where
  the beginning of a header would be emphasized if an asterisk came
  before it.
  (muse-colors-underlined): Don't allow end of underlined text to be the
  beginning of a line.  Don't use memq to check for whitespace syntax; eq
  is sufficient.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-regexps): Mark links later
  on.  We'll use a more clever trick to keep emphasis characters from
  being interpreted in explicit links -- add a custom 'noemphasis text
  property to them.  Move mdash rule further down so that I can add
  designations after blockquoted text.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-word): If beginning or end of
  text has the 'noemphasis property, ignore it.
  (muse-publish-mark-noemphasis): New function that adds the 'noemphasis
  property to the text between BEG and END, or match beginning and end.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-with-temp-buffer): Make sure the buffer is alive
  before trying to set buffer-modified to nil.  This should fix a
  "selecting deleted buffer" error when publishing from command line.
