Summary: muse-mathml: New experimental embedded MathML publisher.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html): Fix docstring.

* experimental/muse-mathml.el: New file that implements a <math> tag.
  With the help of an external program, this will translate LaTeX code
  between <math> and </math> to embedded MathML.  A new style called
  "mathml" is defined, which is derived from the XHTML style, but with a
  more suitable header.
