Summary: WYSIWYG emphasis, XEmacs compatibility hacks.
Keywords: 

* muse-colors.el (muse-colors-emphasized): Make emphasis more WYSIWIG
  compliant.  Only colorize if we end with the same number of asterisks
  as we start with, preventing unnoticed syntax errors.  Don't colorize
  in the middle of a word.
  (muse-colors-underlined): Make underlining more WYSIWIG compliant.
  Only colorize if we end with an underscore.  Don't colorize in the
  middle of a word.

* muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): Move question mark
  inside of group.  This will probably not do anything, but it seems
  syntactically good.

* muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-paragraph): Attempt to deal with case
  where we start with an image link.  JohnW didn't seem to like having
  <p> tags inserted before image links, but they don't validate properly
  as they are.  For now, I will surround such links/paragraphs with <div
  class="image-link"> in an attempt to be as not invasive and yet
  standards compliant as possible.

* muse-html.el (muse-html-escape-string): Work around distinction between
  int and char types in XEmacs.  Deal with an annoying replace-match bug
  in XEmacs that rears its head at times.

* muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-word): Allow underlines to be
  multi-line.
