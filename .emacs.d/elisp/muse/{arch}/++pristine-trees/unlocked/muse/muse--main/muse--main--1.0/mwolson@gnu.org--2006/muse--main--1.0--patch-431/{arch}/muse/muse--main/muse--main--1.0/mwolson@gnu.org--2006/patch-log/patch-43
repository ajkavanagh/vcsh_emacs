Summary: Use slightly better algorithm for removing initial whitespace.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Keep track of whether
  the definition occurred on the same line as the term.
  (muse-publish-surround-text): Use a slightly better algorithm for
  removing initial indentation of list items.  This way, we preserve
  nesting of lists and also deal with same-level items that occur after
  nested items.  This probably doesn't make much of a difference in the
  output, but it should make support of nested definition lists a bit
  less troublesome in some cases.
  (muse-forward-dl-entry): Deal with ambiguity in muse-list-item-regexp
  regexp.
  (muse-forward-dl-part, muse-forward-list-item): Don't clobber match
  data.  Don't remove any text.  This makes the function easier to reuse
  in display-only situations.
