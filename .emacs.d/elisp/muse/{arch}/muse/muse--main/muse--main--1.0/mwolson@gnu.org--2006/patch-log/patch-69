Summary: muse-mode: Don't require muse-publish.el.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-mode.el: Use a few autoloads instead of requiring
  muse-publish.el.  This allows people to optionally have Muse mode
  without including the publishing features, as long as they never call a
  publishing function.  The documentation says that Muse is supposed to
  be modular in that way, so I guess we'd better follow it.
  (muse-insert-tag): Make sure that muse-publish is required before
  accessing `muse-publish-markup-tags'.
