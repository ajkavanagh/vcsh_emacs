Summary: Fix issue with verse tag and initial whitespace
Keywords: 

2007-07-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-verse-tag): Unconditionally
	delete forward one character, since we are guaranteed to be on a
	blank line.  Don't delete all initial whitespace of the first
	line.  This fixes an issue where the output from the verse tag did
	not match the output from Muse's verse syntax.
