Summary: Fix a bug triggered by batch-publishing.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-detect-invalid-style): Remove, since the
  right algorithm turned out to be simpler than I had thought.  Thanks to
  Sergei V. Fleytin for reporting breakage with the old method.
  (muse-publish-file): Don't be overzealous when checking for an invalid
  style -- use a simpler check.
  (muse-batch-publish-files): Don't check for invalid styles here, since
  we already do so in `muse-publish-file'.
