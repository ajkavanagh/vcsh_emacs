	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-url): Allow the original link
	to serve as a description for a URL, as long as it differs from
	the destination URL.  This fixes the description of WikPage links
	in PDF output.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): Use the path
	of the current page as the local path, instead of duplicating the
	remote file's path.  This probably fixes at least one reported
	bug. since it's quite major.
