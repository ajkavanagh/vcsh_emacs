Summary: Checkpoint my definition list publishing changes
Keywords: 

2006-10-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-determine-dl-indent): New
	function that is used as a callback to determine the initial
	amount of indentation that the current dl item has.
	(muse-publish-surround-dl): Use it.  Pass the initial indent value
	and the post-indent value, instead of trying to determine them
	both.
	(muse-publish-strip-list-indentation): New function stripped from
	`muse-publish-surround-text' for readability.
	(muse-publish-surround-text): Instead of taking a determine-indent
	value, take a determine-indent-func function, which is called just
	after finding the next list item.  There are still some definition
	list bugs with this implementation, but I need to checkpoint it.
