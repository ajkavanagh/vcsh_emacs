2006-10-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-choose-style-by-link-suffix)
	(muse-project-resolve-link): If the given style does not have a
	link-suffix, default to suffix.  This fixes a bug I was noticing
	when linking to a file that was published in both PDF and HTML
	form.
