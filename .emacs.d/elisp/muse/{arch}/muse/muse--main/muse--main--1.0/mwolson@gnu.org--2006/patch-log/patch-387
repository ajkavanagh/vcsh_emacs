Summary: muse-journal: Fix bug where tags were not being closed in RDF
Keywords: 

2007-07-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-rss-munge-buffer): Don't
	delete the remainder of the buffer, since this causes the
	resulting RDF to have invalid syntax.  Thanks to Phillip Lord for
	the report and the suggested fix.
