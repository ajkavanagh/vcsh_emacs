Summary: muse-latex2png: Fix several <latex> and <math> issues
Keywords: 

2007-01-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el: Associate <math> tag with
	muse-publish-math-tag, not muse-publish-latex-tag.  Thanks to Jody
	Klymak for the report.
	(muse-publish-math-tag): Use muse-insert-markup for the "$"
	characters, so they don't get escaped.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-derived-p-1): New function to
	make muse-style-derived-p easier to implement.
	(muse-style-derived-p): If the style is not provided, fetch it and
	check to see if the car is a string.  This should fix the other
	problem that was reported.
