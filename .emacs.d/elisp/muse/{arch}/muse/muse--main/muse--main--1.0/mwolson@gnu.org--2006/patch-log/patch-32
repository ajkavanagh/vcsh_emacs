Summary: Make nested list items work when separated by one blank line.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Use
  muse-forward-dl-item instead of muse-forward-list-item.  On second
  thought, don't unconditionally insert a newline, as that breaks some
  things.
  (muse-forward-dl-item): New function that moves forward to the next
  definition list item.  This was factored out from
  muse-forward-list-item, since it was getting too complex for my liking.
  (muse-forward-dl-item, muse-forward-list-item): Introduce concept of
  indented line, and skip past these if we have a blank line followed by
  an indented line.  "Indented" means "indented one past the current
  indentation level" here.  Remove some initial whitespace that was being
  overlooked before.
