Summary: Fix bug with markup that comes immediately after paragraphs 
Keywords: 

2007-05-24  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-ensure-block): Rename from
	`muse-publish-ensure-block-tag', since we will use it for more
	than just tags.
	(muse-publish-markup-list, muse-publish-verse-tag)
	(muse-publish-quote-tag, muse-publish-example-tag)
	(muse-publish-markup-attribute): Use it.  This fixes a bug that
	can occur when these types of markup occur immediately after a
	paragraph.  It's good to have defined behavior!
