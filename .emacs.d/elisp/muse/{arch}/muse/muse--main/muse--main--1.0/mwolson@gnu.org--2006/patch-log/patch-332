Summary: Make it possible to not inline an image
Keywords: 

* NEWS: Update for non-inlined image change.

* examples/Makefile (clean): Clean backup files.

* examples/QuickStart.muse (Images): New section that describes how to
  inline and not inline images.

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-resolve-image-file): Don't touch
  images that have "URL:" in front of them.

* lisp/muse-protocols.el (muse-url-protocols): Add handler for "URL:".
  Use the identity function to resolve, since we don't want to rip "URL:"
  out while publishing, due to some magic that depends on that text.
  (muse-browse-url-url): New function that browses URLs that have "URL:"
  in front of them, by removing the "URL:" part and reprocessing the
  remainder.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-desc-transforms): Add
  `muse-publish-strip-URL' as a default value.
  (muse-publish-classify-url): If target begins with "URL:" return type
  url.
  (muse-publish-strip-URL): New function that strips "URL:" from the
  beginning of a string.  This is used to remove URL: from the link
  description.

* texi/muse.texi (Images): Update for new non-inlined image ability and
  provide example.
