Summary: muse-latex: Call pdflatex twice to get <contents> published.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-pdf-generate): Quote arguments.  Call
  pdflatex twice, since this seems to be necessary to get <contents>
  published.  Thanks to Trent Buck for the heads up.  I wonder if we need
  to call it three times, since this is what John originally did.  Can
  someone please give me advice about this?
