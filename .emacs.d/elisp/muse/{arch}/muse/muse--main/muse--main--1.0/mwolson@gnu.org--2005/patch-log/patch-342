Summary: Nested ordered and unordered lists seem to work now.
Keywords: 

* muse-publish.el (muse-insert-markup-end-list): New function that
  publishes the text with end-list properties.
  (muse-publish-surround-text): If we are looking at a list item while
  stripping whitespace, make sure it has at least one space in front so
  that it gets published correctly.  Use muse-insert-markup-end-list for
  inserting end-tag.
  (muse-forward-list-item): Get the position of the next list-end
  property and use it if point moves past it.  Use `cond' instead of `if'
  for a nicer look.
