New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-86
Summary: Warn if file not published; hack further on Wiki stuff.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-paragraph): Make this only try to
  complete <div> tags that are of the class "image-link".  It is hoped
  that this will prevent user-added <div> tags from being mangled.

* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-link-at-point): Don't pass an argument to
  `muse-handle-implicit-link' or `muse-handle-explicit-link' since they
  need to look at the text at point.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-this-file): Warn the user if the
  current file has not been published since it was up-to-date.  Thanks to
  Bill Freeman for the suggestion.

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-url): Handle case when returned url
  is nil.  If this happens, return the original URL.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-interwiki-regexp): Set using
  `muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp.'
  (muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): New function that sets the value
  of `muse-wiki-interwiki-regexp'.
  (muse-wiki-interwiki-alist): Call `muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp'
  on :set.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-transform-interwiki): Renamed from
  `muse-wiki-expand-interwiki'.
  (muse-wiki-transform-wikiword): New function that prevents WikiWords
  with no matching file from being published as links.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-handle-interwiki): Accept an optional
  string argument once again, since this behavior is needed when
  publishing.
  (muse-wiki-handle-wikiword): Ditto.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-handle-url): Ditto.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-handle-implicit-link): Ditto.  Restore match data
  after every unsuccessful attempt at handling the link.  If argument is
  given, restore match-data at end, too.

* lisp/muse.el (muse-handle-explicit-link): Accept optional string
  argument.  Match data is always saved.  If argument is not given,
  assume that `muse-implicit-link-regexp' has been matched against, and
  return the 1st match string if no handlers worked.
