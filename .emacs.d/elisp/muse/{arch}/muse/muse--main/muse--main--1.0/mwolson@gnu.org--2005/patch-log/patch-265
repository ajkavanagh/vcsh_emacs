Summary: Temporary workaround to make lists work properly again.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): Don't add read-only
  properties to lists, since we need to be able to reduce them in later
  publishing rules for muse-html.  I'd really like to change the way
  lists are marked up so as to obviate the need for this.
