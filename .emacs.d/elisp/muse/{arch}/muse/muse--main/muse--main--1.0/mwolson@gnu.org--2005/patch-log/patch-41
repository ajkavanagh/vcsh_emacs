Summary: Don't let automatic backup files crash the publishing process.
Keywords: 

* muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-markup-regexps): Remove rule for date
  directive since this value is already processed by
  `muse-publish-markup-directive', and may be obtained by using
  the code: (muse-publishing-directive "date").

* muse-colors.el (muse-colors-region): Make sure that we don't ever try
  to run (funcall nil); this happened once during a debugging process.

* muse-project.el (muse-project-private-p): Skip any file for which we
  cannot fetch attributes.  This fixes a bug where having an
  Emacs-generated automatic backup file in a publishing directory causes
  the publishing process to halt with an error.
