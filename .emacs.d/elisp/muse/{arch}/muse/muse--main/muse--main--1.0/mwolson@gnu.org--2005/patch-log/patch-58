New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0--patch-58
Summary: Makefile refactoring.
Keywords: 

* Makefile (.PHONY): List all non-file targets.
  (examples): New rule that calls Make in the examples directory.
  (atranslit): Removed, since this isn't (yet) bundled with Muse.

* README: Move to the examples directory.  I'd prefer to distribute a
  very basic plain text README and use this as a quickstart + markup
  example + publishing example.

* examples/Makefile: Move all README-related rules here.

* examples/README: Add an "About this document" section.  

* scripts/publish (style): Do not include the contrib directory, since we
  don't use any code from there.  Since this is only invoked from the
  examples directory, make sure add the parent directory to the load
  path.

* muse.texi: Change version to 3.00.90 (RC1).

* muse.el: Change location of the README file in header.

* muse.el (muse-version): Update to 3.00.90 (RC1).
