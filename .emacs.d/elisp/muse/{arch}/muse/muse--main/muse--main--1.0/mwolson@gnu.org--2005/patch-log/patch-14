    * muse.texi: Change license terms of the documentation to the GNU
    GPL instead of the GNU FDL, as per the consent of the copyright
    holders of the emacs-wiki manual, from which this is based.  Some
    emacs-wiki-isms in the manual were corrected, and the Getting
    Started section was updated.
