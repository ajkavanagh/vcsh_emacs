Summary: muse-publish: Use narrow-to-region to fix various bugs.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tag): Code indent change.
  (muse-publish-escape-specials): Use `narrow-to-region' so that we
  better define the region to work with.  Thanks to Sacha Chua for the
  advice.  Also make sure that we are more careful with the result from
  next-single-property-change.
  (muse-publish-surround-text): Use narrow-to-region.  Make this routine
  less brain-dead.
  (muse-publish-verse-tag): Use narrow-to-region.
