Summary: Work around a truly abominable tilde-in-path edge case in TeX

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-pdf-program): New option that
	specifies the program to call in order to generate PDF content
	from LaTeX content.
	(muse-latex-pdf-cruft): New option that specifies the extensions
	of files to remove after generating PDF output successfully.
	(muse-latex-pdf-generate): Use these new options.  Work around the
	annoying edge case where a tilde character exists in the filename
	or directory path -- now this can only error out when the relative
	path from the output file to the source file contains a tilde,
	which is far less likely.

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-pdf-generate): Rewrite to
	call `muse-latex-pdf-generate' with pdftex as the generating
	binary, because texi2pdf suffers irredeemably from the tilde edge
	case mentioned above.
