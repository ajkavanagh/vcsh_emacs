Summary: Allow bad WikiWords to be colorized, by popular request.
Keywords: 

* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-link-face): Allow implicit links to be
  colored as bad links if they don't correspond with a real file.  Make
  the code more straightforward.

* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-allow-nonexistent-wikiword): New option
  that determines whether to colorize nonexistent WikiWords.  The default
  is nil, which means "don't colorize".
  (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page, muse-wiki-handle-wikiword): Adapt for
  the possibility of bad WikiWords.
