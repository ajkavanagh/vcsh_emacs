Summary: various minor fixes
Keywords:

* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-insert-anchor): postpone html warning fix, too much annoyance

* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-regexps): perform email adress after url substitution in case of email-like motif in "url"
(muse-publish-url): there seems to be some problems when functions in muse-publish-url-transforms are not protected with save-match-data
(muse-publish-insert-url): make the published url read-only to avoid further substitution (like email adress in description)
