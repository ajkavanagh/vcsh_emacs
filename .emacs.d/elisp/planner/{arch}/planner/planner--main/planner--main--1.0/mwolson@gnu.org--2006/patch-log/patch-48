Summary: Fix lock up with old delegated task mark.
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-marks-regexp): Docfix.
  (planner-task-regexp): Don't include marks; be more lenient, since
  planner-id uses this as a metric for finding a task, and we don't want
  tasks with strange marks to cause it not to find a task.
  (plan): Indentation.
