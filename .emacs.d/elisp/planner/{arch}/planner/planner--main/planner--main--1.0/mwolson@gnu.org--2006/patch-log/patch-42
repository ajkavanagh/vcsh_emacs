Summary: Work on calendar, manual, and index generation.
Keywords: 

* planner-calendar.el: Fix example in header.  Remove the word "wiki"
  from everything, since "page" works better.
  (planner-calendar-coerce-day-page): New function that determines which
  day page to base the calendar on.
  (planner-calendar-from-page): Use `planner-calendar-coerce-day-page'.
  Check for null page name.
  (planner-calendar-create-today-link): Make sure that the page we are
  linking to actually exists.  This function should now be safe to add
  globally to muse-after-publish-hook.
  (planner-publish-calendar-tag): If no calendar is returned, don't
  insert anything.
  ("planner-publish-finalize-regexps"): Use a better regexp to match the
  calendar tag, so that it is processed correctly.

* planner-el.texi: Add subheadings for Keys, Options, and Functions, if
  applicable.
  (Publishing Calendars): Mention "page" and "arrows" options.  Mention
  workaround for problem where the text in the arrows doesn't get
  published correctly.  Give working example for
  planner-calendar-create-today-link.

* planner.el (planner-published-file): Try to figure out where the file
  exists, if the output directory is not specified.  This could be more
  elaborate to handle multiple source directories, but I haven't gotten
  around to that yet.
  (planner-index-as-string): Add exclude-daypages option for those who do
  not want day pages to show up in the index.
