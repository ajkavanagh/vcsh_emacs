Summary: planner-publish: fix task publishing
Keywords: 

* planner-publish.el (planner-html-markup-strings): Change
  planner-end-task so that it doesn't include the links, and has the
  correct [?] number of closing spans.
  (planner-publish-markup-task): Use planner-task-link-text for the
  links, so we get them all.
  (planner-publish-task-tag): Avoid making links readonly, so they can be
  handled by other publishing rules.  Don't add links where there are
  none [don't add "()", that is].
