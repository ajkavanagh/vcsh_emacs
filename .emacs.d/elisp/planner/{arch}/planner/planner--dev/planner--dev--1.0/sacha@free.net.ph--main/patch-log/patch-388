Summary: Tweak: planner-copy-or-move-region does not include last line if at start of line
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-copy-or-move-region): Minor tweak: Do not include
  last line if point is at the first character of the task. This makes
  selecting a region of tasks easier, and corresponds better to
  transient-mark-mode.
