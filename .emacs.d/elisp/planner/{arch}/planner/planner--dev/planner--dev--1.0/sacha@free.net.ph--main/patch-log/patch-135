Summary: Menu tweaks: planner notes submenu, new keybindings
Keywords: improvement, note

	* planner.el: Merge patch from Michael Olson.
	(planner-install-extra-note-keybindings): Add a new function
	`planner-install-extra-note-keybindings', modeled after
	`planner-install-extra-task-keybindings', that makes all of the
	note-related entries in the Planner menu keyboard-accessible. The
	prefix for all of these keys is C-c C-o, since C-c C-n was already
	in use.
	(planner-menu): Add a submenu called "Notes" to the Planner menu.
	(planner-menu): Fix the "Info" menu entry so that it brings up the
	planner info manual instead of displaying a message. This item is
	now called "Info manual".
	(planner-menu): Change the Goto submenu so that the word "Goto" is
	removed from the beginning of each entry. It seems ambiguous to
	have it there.
