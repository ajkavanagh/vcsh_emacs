Summary: Use `planner-current-file' to get around the temp file issue.
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-current-file): New function that returns the name
  of the file that is currently being published.  Make sure you use this
  instead of `buffer-file-name' if your routine is called at
  publish-time.  For safety, this makes sure that
  `emacs-wiki-current-file' is bound and not null before using it; falls
  back on the value of the `buffer-file-name' variable.

* planner-diary.el (planner-diary-get-name): Use `planner-current-file'.

* planner-rss.el (planner-rss-limit): Ditto.
