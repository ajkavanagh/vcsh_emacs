Summary: tidying up
Keywords: 

* planner-appt.el: small documentation changes; moved lots of
things around for code readability; nicer customization

(planner-appt-write-file-hook): new global variable for the
preferred write-hook

(planner-appt-seek-to-end-of-current-section): new function: does
what it says

(planner-appt-live-task-regexp): new regular expression matching
tasks that are not cancelled and not finished

(planner-appt-de-wiki): made this more lispy with catch and throw
[but couldn't find simple `loop' outside of `cl']

(planner-appt-show-alerts): new command to show a list of
scheduled alerts

(planner-appt-schedule-add-cyclic): made the sorting contingent
upon planner-appt-sort-schedule-on-update-flag

(planner-appt-update, planner-appt-insinuate-if-today): added some
bullet-proofing to make sure there is an initial update
