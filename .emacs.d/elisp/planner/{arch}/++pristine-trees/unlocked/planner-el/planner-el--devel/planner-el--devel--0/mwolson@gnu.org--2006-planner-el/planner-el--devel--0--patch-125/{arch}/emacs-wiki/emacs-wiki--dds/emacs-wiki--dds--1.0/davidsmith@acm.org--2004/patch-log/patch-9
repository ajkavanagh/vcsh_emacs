Summary: save-excursion in planner-read-date
Keywords: 

A save-excursion is necessary in planner-read-date because
save-window-excursion does not save the location of point in buffer;
it saves which window is active. The location of point in buffer is
necessary when planner-copy-or-move-task calls
planner-current-task-info; the symptom is that
planner-copy-or-move-task operates on the first task in the buffer,
not the task that point was on when the operation started.
