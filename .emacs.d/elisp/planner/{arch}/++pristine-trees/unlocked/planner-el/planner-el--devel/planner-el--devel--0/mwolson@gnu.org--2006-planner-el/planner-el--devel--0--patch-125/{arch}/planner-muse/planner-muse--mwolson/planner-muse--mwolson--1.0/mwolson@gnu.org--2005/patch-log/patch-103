Summary: Make tasks overview, notes index, and a few other things work.
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-current-file): Defalias this to muse-current-file.
  (planner-list-daily-files, planner-get-day-pages): Return an alist
  rather than a date list.
  (planner-get-previous-existing-day, planner-get-next-existing-day)
  (planner-search-notes-internal, planner-past-notes-tag)
  (planner-index-as-string, plan): Adapt to deal with alist.
  (planner-extract-tasks): Deal with both alists and page lists.
  (planner-list-tasks-with-status): Implement handling of PAGES parameter
  as specified by the manual.

* planner-tasks-overview.el (planner-tasks-overview-extract-all-tasks):
  Use the filename rather than the page name.  Thanks to Janne Hellston
  and Seth Falcon for the heads up.

* planner-notes-index.el (planner-notes-index-headlines-in-range): Deal
  with alist rather than page list.

* planner-export-diary.el (planner-export-diary-get-schedule-entries):
  Ditto.
