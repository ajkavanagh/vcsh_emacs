Summary: Place the annotation in task title where I want
Keywords: newfeature, update

* planner.el: Sometimes I want to place the annotation in the task
  description instead of at the end of task description to get a more
  readable one. This patch makes this possible.
  (planner-manual-place-annotation): If set to non-nil, decide where
  annotation goes manually. It is set to nil by default to keep the
  original behavior.
  (planner-annotation-symbol-string): When
  planner-create-task-from-buffer, this string in the task description
  will be replace by the annotation calculated by
  planner-annotation-functions.
  (planner-create-task-from-buffer): Utilize
  planner-manual-place-annotation and planner-annotation-symbol-string so
  I can type "reply /anno/ for something" in Gnus and so on to get a
  better task title.
