Summary: fix problem if planner-multi is loaded and there are space in bookmark name
Keywords: bugfix

* planner-bookmark.el (planner-bookmark-make-url): With
  planner-multi-separator set to " " (the default), if there are space in
  the bookmark name, the defadviced version of planner-make-link will
  seperate the bookmark name by space and make several links, which is
  not what we want. Changing the call from planner-make-link to
  emacs-wiki-make-link fix this.
