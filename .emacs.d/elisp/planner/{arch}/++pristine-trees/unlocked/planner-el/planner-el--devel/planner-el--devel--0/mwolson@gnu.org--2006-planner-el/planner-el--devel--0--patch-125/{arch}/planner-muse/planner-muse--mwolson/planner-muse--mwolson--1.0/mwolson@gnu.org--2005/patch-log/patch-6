Summary: Patch from Peter K. Lee; make it less work to get started using this.
Keywords: 

* planner.el: Apply patch from Peter K. Lee.  Require `muse-mode' instead
  of `muse'.
  (planner-option-customized): Since there are still a lot of functions
  that call this, keep it for now.
  (planner-page-exists-p): This is sometimes called with 2 arguments
  instead of 1, so defalias it to `planner-page-file'.

* planner.el (planner-version): Change to "Planner (Muse)" so that this
  is somewhat meaningful.
  (planner-regexp-space): Make the default value equivalent to
  `muse-regexp-space'.
  (planner-update-wiki-project): Bring this back, but make it do nothing.
  I want to make the instructions on the PlannerMusePort wiki page a bit
  simpler.
  (planner-markup-tags): Ditto.
