New-patches: mwolson@gnu.org--2005/planner-muse--mwolson--1.0--patch-152
Summary: Fix double-escaping issue.
Keywords: 

* Makefile (install): Install the manual as "planner", not
  "planner-muse".

* Makefile.defs (ELISPDIR): Install the elisp files to site-lisp/planner
  rather than site-lisp/planner-muse.

* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-markup-note): Apply patch from Dale
  Smith that fixes a double-escaping of specials with muse--main.
  (planner-publish-section-tag): Revert a previous whitespace patch.
  (planner-publish-content-tag): Insert an additional newline.  Hopefully
  this finally fixes the paragraph detection problem.
