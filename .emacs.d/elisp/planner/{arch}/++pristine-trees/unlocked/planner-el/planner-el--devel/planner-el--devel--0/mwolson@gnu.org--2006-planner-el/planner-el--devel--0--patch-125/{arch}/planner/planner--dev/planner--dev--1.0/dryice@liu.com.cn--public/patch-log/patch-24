Keywords: newfeature, merge

* planner-trunk.el: Lots of changes, changing planner-trunk-rule-list
  format to support trunk on plan pages and add sub-section
  headers. Here's the docstring of planner-trunk-rule-list, describing
  the new features:

    "List of rules for trunking tasks
  
  Each rule is a sublist of the form:
  
     (PAGE-REGEXP COMPLETE-HEADING TRUNK-SECTIONS-LIST)
  
  PAGE-REGEXP is used to select the set of trunk sections that should be
  used.  It is matched against the name of the current planner page.  If
  no matching PAGE-REGEXP is found, no trunking is done.  If there is
  more than one match, the first one in the list is used.
  
  If COMPLETE-HEADING is nil, completed and not completed tasks will be
  in the same trunk, sorted according to `PLANNER-SORT-TASKS-KEY-FUNCTION'.
  If it is a string, it is the name of a sub-heading of the tasks
  section under which to sort completed tasks separately, in which
  case it will be the last subsection of the tasks section of the page.
  
  Each element of TRUNK-SECTIONS-LIST describes a trunk of the page.
  Elements can either be a simple TASK-PLAN-REGEXP, or a sublist of the form:
  
     (TASK-PLAN-REGEXP TRUNK-HEADING)
  
  The TASK-PLAN-REGEXP is matched against the plan page (or pages if you
  are using planner-multi) for the task.  If more than one
  TASK-PLAN-REGEXP matches, the first one in the list is used.  All
  tasks that match the same TASK-PLAN-REGEXP will be grouped together.
  The order of the groups will match the order of TRUNK-SECTIONS-LIST.
  Tasks that do not match any entry in TRUNK-SECTIONS-LIST will be in a
  separate group at the end of the tasks section.  If the sublist form
  of an entry is used, TRUNK-HEADING is a name for the outline heading
  to be inserted at the top of the trunk.  If TRUNK-SECTIONS-LIST
  contains a mix of items in the regexp and sublist forms, when tasks
  are present that match a regexp form entry, but no tasks are present
  that match the most recent preceeding sublist form entry in the list,
  the heading from the sublist form entry will be inserted anyway.  In
  use, it will become obvious why this is desirable."
