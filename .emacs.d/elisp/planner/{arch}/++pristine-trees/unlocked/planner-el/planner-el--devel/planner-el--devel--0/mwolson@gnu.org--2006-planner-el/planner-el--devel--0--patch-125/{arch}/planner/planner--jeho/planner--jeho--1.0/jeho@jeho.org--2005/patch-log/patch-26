Summary: massive changes
Keywords: 

* planner-appt.el: documentation changes

Moved lots of functions around around.

Made font-locking work for schedules.

Fixed a problem with the task-based method where it wasn't
cleaning up after itself.

Smoothed out the user interface, and integrated the two methods
better, renamed a few functions to make them consistent. 

Changed after-save hooks to local-write-file-hooks

Changed the hooking so that it only happens for today's plan page
[pointless to have these hooks elsewhere, despite my earlier sentiments
to the contrary]

sorry about the terse change log
