Summary: planner-multi-task-delete-this-page
Keywords: 

* planner-multi.el (planner-multi-task-delete-this-page): Remove the page
  to delete from the link list correctly. Allow for various cases
  previously unaccommodated: two links becomes a single link, one link
  becomes no link at all.  This also required allowing the regexp to
  match on a single link.
