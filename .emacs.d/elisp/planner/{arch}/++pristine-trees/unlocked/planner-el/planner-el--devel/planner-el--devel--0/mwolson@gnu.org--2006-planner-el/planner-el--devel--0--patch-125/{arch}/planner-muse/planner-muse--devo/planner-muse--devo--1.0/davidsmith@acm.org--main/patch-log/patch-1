Summary: integration with muse mode
Keywords: 

This is a first-draft implementation of RSS support for planner-muse,
completely not backwards-compatible.

Naturally there is a lot of room for a better implementation but the code
is much smaller and simpler than the previous planner-rss.el.

Hopefully this can get other people hacking.
