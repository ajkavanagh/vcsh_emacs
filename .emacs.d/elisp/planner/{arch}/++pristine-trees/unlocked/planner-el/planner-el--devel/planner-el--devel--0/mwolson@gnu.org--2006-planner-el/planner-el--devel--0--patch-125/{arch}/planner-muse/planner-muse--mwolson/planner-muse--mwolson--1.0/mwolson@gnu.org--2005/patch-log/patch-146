Summary: planner-publish: Work further on <notes> and <past-notes> tags.
Keywords: 

* planner-publish.el (planner-html-markup-strings): Split
  planner-note-details into manageable chunks.
  (planner-publish-markup-note, planner-publish-notes-section-tag):
  s/notes/notes-section/.  Thanks to Dale Smith for the patch.
  (planner-publish-past-notes-tag): Fix the name of this function, thanks
  to Dale Smith.  Make it use planner-insert-markup in some parts so that
  raw HTML doesn't get escaped.
  (planner-publish-note-tag): Split up the 'planner-note-details string
  so that we can be selective about the parts that are marked up as
  read-only.
