	Changelog from John Sullivan; thanks for the patch!
	* planner.texi (Preface): Added xref to Acknowledgements.
	(Components): Moved bit about the relationship with EmacsWikiMode
	to hear from the Introduction.
	(Introduction): Fleshed out and organized the writing a bit,
	trying to give a better idea of what to expect and how to proceed.
	(Stable Version): Reorganized install information to cut down on
	redunancies, improve flow, and make everything specific to stable
	version.
	(Development Version): Did the same for the development
	version. Moved extra arch information to the bottom of the
	section. Thinking about consolidating arch information in its own
	separate section.

	chapter to Maintainers and Contributors.
