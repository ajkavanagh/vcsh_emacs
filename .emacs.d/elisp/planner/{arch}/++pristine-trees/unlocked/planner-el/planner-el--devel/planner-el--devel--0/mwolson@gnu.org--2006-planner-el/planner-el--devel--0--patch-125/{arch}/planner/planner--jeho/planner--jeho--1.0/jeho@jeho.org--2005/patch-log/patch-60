Summary: planner-appt: create task fix, better advising, etc.
Keywords: 

* planner-appt.el 

Quite a few changes here: 

Fixed a bug in task creation with multi links: previously, there would
either be an error [if the task ends up added to an empty page] or the
wrong task line would be considered for appointment adding [these
problems due to idiosyncrasies in planner-multi].

Debugging macros and functions.

Better advising: while investigating the task creation bug, I
found that there were many redundant calls to the function advice,
so I have added code temporarily to switch the advice off. I also
noticed that the advice to `planner-update-task' couldn't possibly
do anything useful before, since the current task line is
unaffected by `planner-update-task', but that some advice was
called for; so I added something here.  This, however, turned out
to be far too slow for the mass updating done by
`planner-id-update-tasks-on-page', so I added some advice for that
too.

There are also improvements to the advising itself [preactivation
and avoiding using ad-foo-regexp], with some speed gains.

(planner-appt-live-task-regexp): fixed matching just whitespace
after the task status

(planner-appt-debug-buffer, planner-appt-debug-flag)
(planner-appt-debug, planner-appt-debug-message): new debugging
functionality

(--planner-appt-task-cache, planner-appt-task-parse-task): added
memoizing optimization

(planner-schedule-task-estimate): added a docstring

(planner-appt-task-add, planner-appt-task-delete): re-organized to
make more efficient and more readable

(--planner-appt-advice, planner-appt-advice-common-flags): support
for new advising stuff; `--planner-appt-advice' holds information
about advice added by `planner-appt-defadvice',
`planner-appt-advice-common-flags' flags that are used in all
advice.  Preactivation of advice added here for load-time
efficiency

(planner-appt-defadvice): defadvice macro wrapper that remembers
the advice args for later use

(planner-appt-disable-all-advice, planner-appt-enable-all-advice):
new functions: enable/disable all advice added with
`planner-appt-defadvice'

(with-planner-appt-task-advice-disabled): temporary disabling of
advice added with `planner-appt-defadvice'

(planner-task-cancelled, planner-task-done, planner-delete-task):
now use `planner-appt-defadvice'

(planner-appt-get-diff-links, planner-update-task): enhanced
handling of `planner-update-task': previous code didn't actually
do anything

(planner-id-update-tasks-on-page): for speed, advised to avoid
lots of update advice

(plan): replaced the setq with a let clause

(planner-copy-or-move-task): disable planner-appt advice while
this advice is active; fixed bug in handling of planner-multi
dates

(planner-edit-task-description): use `planner-appt-defadvice'

(--planner-appt-created-task-marker): support for create task
advice

(--planner-appt-close-the-buffer-flag): support for create task
advice

(planner-appt-create-task-hook-func): remember the place where the
task was created, so it can be revisited to update appointments

(planner-create-task-from-info): visit the place where the task
was created, update appointments, and behave according to
`planner-tasks-file-behavior'

(planner-appt-methods): moved up the file to avoid
byte-compilation warning

(planner-appt-use): change function added to
`planner-create-task-hook' to
`planner-appt-create-task-hook-func'; moved the advice enabling to
the end of the function [so advice can be explicitly disabled if
the task method is not used [otherwise there is a problem with
preactivation]]

(planner-appt-de-insinuate): updated to take changes to hooks and
advice handling into account
