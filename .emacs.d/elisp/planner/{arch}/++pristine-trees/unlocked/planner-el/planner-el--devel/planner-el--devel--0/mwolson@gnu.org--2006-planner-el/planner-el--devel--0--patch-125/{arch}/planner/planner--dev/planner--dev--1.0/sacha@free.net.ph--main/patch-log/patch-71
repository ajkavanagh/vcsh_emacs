Summary: NOTE: Changed behavior of planner-carry-tasks-forward, now default for FORCE-DAYS (with minor tweaks)
Keywords: 

	* planner.el (planner-carry-tasks-forward): NOTE: Now behaves
	similar to the FORCE-DAYS parameter of `plan'. Defaults to
	scanning the past three days _AND_ carrying the tasks forward, as
	this makes more sense for new users. Always checks for new tasks.
	(plan): Follow new meaning of planner-carry-tasks-forward as the
	default.
