Summary: Bugfix: planner-calendar-published-file-href: Stop refreshing the file list all the time
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-page-file): Don't change projects, as the
  underlying functions use variables properly.

* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-published-file-href): Don't keep
  refreshing the file alist. This should make it faster. Thanks to drkm for
  pointing this out.
