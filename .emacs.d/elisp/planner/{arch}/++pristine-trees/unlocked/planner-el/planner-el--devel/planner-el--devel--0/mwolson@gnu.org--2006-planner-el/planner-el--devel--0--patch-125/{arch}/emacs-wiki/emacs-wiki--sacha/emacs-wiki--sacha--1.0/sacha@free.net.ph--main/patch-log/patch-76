Summary: Renamed p-i-c to planner-calendar-insinuate to be more consistent
Keywords: 

	* planner.el (planner-calendar-insinuate): Renamed from
	planner-insinuate-calendar to be more consistent with other
	functions. Thanks to Yvonne Thomson for pointing this out.

	* planner-diary.el: Clarified documentation. Adopted it for my own
	use, so if this breaks, I'll be one of those to complain loudly.
