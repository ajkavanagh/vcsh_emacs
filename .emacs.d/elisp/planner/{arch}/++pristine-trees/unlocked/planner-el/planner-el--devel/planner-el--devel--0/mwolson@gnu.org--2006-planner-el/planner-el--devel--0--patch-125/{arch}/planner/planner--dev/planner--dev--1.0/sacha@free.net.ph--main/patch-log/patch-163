Summary: Merge patch for planner-create-note whitespacing
Keywords: external, improvement

	* planner.el: Merge 2004-09-12 patch from Michael Olson
        (mwolson AT member.fsf.org). His changelog follows.
        (planner-project): Make this variable customizable so
	that people are not stuck with "WikiPlanner" as the project name.
	(planner-seek-task-creation-point): Use (bolp) instead of a
	much-longer method to determine whether the point is at the
	beginning of the line.
	(planner-create-note): Ditto.  Only insert newlines if we are not
	at the end of the buffer.
