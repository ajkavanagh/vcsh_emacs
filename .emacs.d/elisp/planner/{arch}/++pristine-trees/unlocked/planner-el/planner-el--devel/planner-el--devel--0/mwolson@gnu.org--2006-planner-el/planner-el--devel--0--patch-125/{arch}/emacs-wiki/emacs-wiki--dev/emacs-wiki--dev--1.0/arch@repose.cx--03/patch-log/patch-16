This patch allows you to specify a path to an image in the description part
of an extended link, which is especially useful for thumbnails. Thanks to
Gary Vaughan (gary AT gnu DOT org) for this patch.

(emacs-wiki-markup-link): check if the link and description fields are the
    same - if not, and the description is an image, mark it up as an anchored
    image
