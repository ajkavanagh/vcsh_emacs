Summary: new rank calculating functions taking weight in to consideration
Keywords: newfeature

* planner-rank.el: Now we have some algorithms that emphasis Importancy
more than Urgency.
(planner-rank-importancy-vs-urgency-factor): new customizable variable
(planner-rank-rank-calculate-function): change the default to
planner-rank-calculate-rank-weighing-rmsd. With the default settings,
this one get a pretty reasonable result. I like this one :)

function that take weight in to account.
(planner-rank-calculate-rank-weighing-rmsd): Ditto.
