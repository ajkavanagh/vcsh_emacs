Sigh. There's three different read syntaxs for octals - ?\666, ?\0666, and
#o666. Not one of them are supported across all recent emacsen - so decimal
literals have to be used in their place. It's not even possible to wrap the
literal in a if clause, since the read syntax is evaluated regardless of if
the macro chooses to evaluate that argument or not.
