Summary: planner-report update from ajk
Keywords: external patch

	* planner-report.el: Merge update from ajk. From ajk: Fix bugs
	that caused some tasks and notes to be left out. Remove redundant
	code.
	(planner-report-remove-tasks-numbers): New customization option
	planner-report-remove-task-numbers enables removal of task
	priority numbers in status reports (they don't increment
	per-project and therefore don't mean much).
	(planner-report-replace-note-numbers): New customization option
	planner-report-replace-note-numbers enables replacement of note
	numbers (again, they don't mean much in a status report) with some
	string (defaults to "**").
	(planner-report-unfinished-offset): New customization option
	planner-report-unfinished-offset specifies the number of days from
	the current date of unfinished tasks to include in the status
	report. Before, all unfinished tasks were included.
