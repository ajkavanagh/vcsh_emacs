Summary: Tasks are colored according to their category
Keywords: 

Ephrem Christopher Walborn suggested making planner-markup-tasks color
A tasks red, B tasks blue, and C tasks green. This patch colors it
as suggested.

New function planner-markup-region chooses between overlays and text
properties, using overlays whenever possible. Seems to work, and
allows me to easily combine different attributes.

planner-id.el now uses the new planner-markup-region.

Also, planner-id.el is now UNIX-encoded.
