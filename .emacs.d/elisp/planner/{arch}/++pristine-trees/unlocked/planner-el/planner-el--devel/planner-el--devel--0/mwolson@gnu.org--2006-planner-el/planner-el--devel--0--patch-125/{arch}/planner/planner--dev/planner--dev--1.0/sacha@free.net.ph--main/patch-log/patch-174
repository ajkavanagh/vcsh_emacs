Summary: NOTE: planner-diary.el: Remove font-locking method 
Keywords: devolution

	* planner-diary.el: After much bug-hunting, I have decided to
	remove the fontlocking code from the module as it causes too many
	headaches. If you want it back in, please send me a working patch.
	=)

	* planner.texi (Diary): Docfix: Remove mention of Lisp
	fontlocking feature.
