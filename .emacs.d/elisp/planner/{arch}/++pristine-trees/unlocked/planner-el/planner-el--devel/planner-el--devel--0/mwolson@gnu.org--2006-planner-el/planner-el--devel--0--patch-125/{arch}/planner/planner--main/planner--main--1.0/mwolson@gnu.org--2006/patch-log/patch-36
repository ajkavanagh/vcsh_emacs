Summary: Make publishing of calendars work better using a new method.

  header and footer.
  (planner-calendar-insert-calendar-maybe) 
  (planner-calendar-move-calendar-to-top-of-page-maybe): Remove, since
  they are not needed by the new method.

  specifies the publishing regexps to apply before doing other
  publishing.
