* planner-appt.el: 

Added copyright and licence notice.

Created friendlier configuration functions
`planner-appt-use-tasks', `planner-appt-use-schedule', and
`planner-appt-use-tasks-and-schedule'. Modified documentation as
appropriate.

(planner-appt-earlier-than-now-p): Renamed
`planner-appt-time-old-p' to the more informative
`planner-appt-earlier-than-now-p'.

Added `planner-appt-later-than-now-p' to satisfy a mania for
symmetry.

(planner-appt-schedule-appt-regexp): Modified so that it captures
the second time in a schedule entry: it could be useful for some
other schedule handling code.

(planner-appt-use): Made this  idempotent, substituting `add-to-list'
 for `push'.

(planner-appt-task-add, planner-appt-task-delete): Added check
that there is a current task.  Without this there was an
uninformative error message. Added optional argument INFO: use
that instead of the current task info [useful to save visiting
today's plan page to add appointments [see advice to
`planner-copy-or-move-task']].

(planner-appt-task-delete): Return a list of deleted appointments
in the format used in `appt-time-msg-list' [can be useful in some
cases]. 

(planner-appt-task-member): Renamed `planner-appt-task-added-p' to
this to hint that it behaves like `member'.


(plan): Added advise to this so that the advice to
planner-copy-or-move-task can know whether `plan' is being
called; protected against error.  I hate function advice!

(planner-copy-or-move-task): Modified advice a lot to make it
delete and add appointments correctly, and also to handle errors
within the advised function.  This seems to be the only advice
that requires such elaborate handling: in the others any problems
are trapped by the test for a current task line added to
`planner-appt-task-delete'.

Added handling for when `plan' has been called: don't carry a task
forward if it is an appointment.

(planner-schedule-task-estimate): Moved the require into this
function to save loading if tasks are not being used.
