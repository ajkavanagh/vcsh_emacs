Summary: planner-publish: Make "* Notes" section publish correctly again.
Keywords: 

* planner-publish.el: Re-add the planner-publish-notes-tag function, but
  rename to planner-publish-notes-section.  emacs-wiki had the <notes>
  tag insert an index of notes, so we'll use that as the behavior of
  <notes>.  We still need the other function, though, to publish the 
  "* Notes" section.  Thanks to Dale Smith for the advice.
  (planner-publish-markup-tags): Add notes-section tag
  (planner-publish-notes-section-tag): Renamed from the old
  planner-publish-notes-tag function.
  (sectionalize-markup-tagname): Mark up "* Notes" section as
  "notes-section" instead of "notes".
