Summary: Bugfix: planner-replan-note should properly add notes to non-wiki-named pages
Keywords: 

* planner.el (planner-replan-note): Bugfix: Go back to beginning of
buffer whenever searching for a note. Also, get the base of the note page
link when concatenating a new reference to it. This means that links
specified with [[ and ]] should work.

* planner-multi.el (planner-replan-note): Add current link only if it is
not already in the list. Also, get the base of the note page
link when concatenating a new reference to it.
