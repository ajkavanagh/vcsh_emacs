Summary: planner-renumber-tasks renumbers chunks of tasks
Keywords: 

	* planner.el (planner-renumber-tasks): Renumber chunks of tasks,
	not only the first one. This lets you have a Completed Tasks
	section, although you still have to manually move tasks over to
	it. Maybe we can have a hook to control this, if other people find
	"Completed Tasks" interesting.
