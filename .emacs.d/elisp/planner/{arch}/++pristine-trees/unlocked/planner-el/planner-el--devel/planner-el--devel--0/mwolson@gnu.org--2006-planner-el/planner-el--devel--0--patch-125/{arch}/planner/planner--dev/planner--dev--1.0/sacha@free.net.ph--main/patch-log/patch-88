Summary: planner-export-diary: Simplify code, do not use insert-contents-literally
Keywords: 

	* planner-export-diary.el (planner-export-diary-future): Use
	planner-export-diary.
	(planner-export-diary-get-schedule-entries): Do not insert
	contents literally.  Allow spaces at the start of appointment
	lines.  Construct the list using cons instead of append. Note:
	This function does not guarantee any particular order.  Thanks
	to Xin Wei Hu for bug report and patch for both changes.
