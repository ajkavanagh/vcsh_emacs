Summary: Debian package refinements.
Keywords: 

* Makefile (debrevision): New rule that causes a Debian package with a
  revision to be built.  The main difference between this and
  `debrelease' is that the .orig.tar.gz file is left alone.
  (debbuild): New rule factored from debrelease.
  (debclean): Removed, since we use slightly differing variations of this
  in debrelease and debrevision.

* debian/README.Debian: Add comments and my debian repo.

* debian/emacsen-install: Make sure we symlink planner-autoloads.el.  Thanks to
  Romain Francoise for noticing.

* debian/rules: DTRT with NEWS and README.Debian.
