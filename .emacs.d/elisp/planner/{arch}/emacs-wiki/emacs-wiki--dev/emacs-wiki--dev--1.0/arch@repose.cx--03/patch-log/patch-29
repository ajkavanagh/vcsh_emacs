Windows machines (maybe others) don't support checking for updated
files based on mtime, so (emacs-wiki-file-alist) has to rescan all
files in the wiki directories. The idea with refresh-buffer was to
accept a child buffer in which to base information on - that
file/wiki name was added to the file alist when the file was saved,
without having to rescan the directory contents.

The problem was that this code was a bit buggy, and unless you have
huge wiki directories it shouldn't be a problem anyway. If you're
using a system which is affected by this change, let me know - and of
course, patches are welcome. It's a bit of a hack though, so better
solutions are preferable.
