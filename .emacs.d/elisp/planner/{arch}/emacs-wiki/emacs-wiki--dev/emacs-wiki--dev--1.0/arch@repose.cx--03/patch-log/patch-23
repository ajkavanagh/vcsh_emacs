(emacs-wiki-rename-link-at-point) now understands [[extendedLinks]]
and will automatically make an extended link if the new name you
provide isn't a valid wiki name in itself.

(emacs-wiki-highlight-link) marks the hidden [[ ]] characters up in
the relevant face, since emacs sometimes positions point on them even
though they're intangible (such as after font-locking). this fixes
some problems that you can run into when toggling font-lock off and
on at the start of a link.
