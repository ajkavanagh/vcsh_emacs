Summary: use a default project, instead of no project
Keywords: 

Previously a 'nil' project was used when finding files listed in
emacs-wiki-directories defined outside of an explicit project in
`emacs-wiki-projects'. This caused a bit of confusion for people
about what project was in effect.

This change makes it so that there is always a project in use.
Settings defined outside of the alist in emacs-wiki-projects will be
associated with `emacs-wiki-default-project'.
