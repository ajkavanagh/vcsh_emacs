Removed-patches: 

When following a badlink, and saving the resulting buffer, the linking buffer
is updated to reflect the fact that the link now exists. Any other buffers
currently displaying the badlink will not be updated, but they can be
"flushed" by toggling font-lock.

(emacs-wiki-visit-link): accept an optional buffer to refresh on save
(emacs-wiki-refresh-buffer): new command to support refreshing a buffer when
    a badlink becomes a normal link. You can run it interactively to scan the
    filesystem for any new links, and redraw the buffer.
(emacs-wiki-follow-name-at-point): check if the link to visit is a bad one,
    and advise (emacs-wiki-visit-link) appropriately
(add-once-hook): helper function to add a single-run hook
