Previously a project InterWiki that was not qualified with # would cause an
error when publishing / highlighting. A patch from Gary Vaughan (gary /at/
gnu.org) corrects this so that the bare link becomes a link to the home page
of that project.

Some additional header faces have been added to support the extra faces wikis
like MoinMoin use. The code to display MoinMoin wiki markup is not currently
included, though.
