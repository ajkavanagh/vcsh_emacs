Summary: Added fboundp check for remove-overlays
Keywords: 

   Apparently, older Emacsen don't have the remove-overlays function.
   Added fboundp check. Strange - if there's an overlay, how does one
   propose to remove all of them anyway? Anyway, planner-markup-region
   should do the right thing now.
