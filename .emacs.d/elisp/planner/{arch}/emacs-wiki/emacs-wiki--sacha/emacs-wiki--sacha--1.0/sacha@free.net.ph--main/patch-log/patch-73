Summary: Added planner-notes-index.el, fixed emacs-wiki escape/unescape
Keywords: 

	* planner-notes-index.el: New file. View a list of your notes
	using the interactive functions, or publish indexes using
	emacs-wiki tags. See comments for more details.

	* emacs-wiki.el (emacs-wiki-link-escape): Finally fix this broken
	function. I must have been really lucky not to have run into
	problems with this before. Apologies to people bemused by this
	bug!
	(emacs-wiki-link-unescape): Same as emacs-wiki-link-escape.
	(emacs-wiki-highlight-link): Unescape link text when displayed.
	Tested with notes-index, which had lots of links with brackets.
	(emacs-wiki-wiki-visible-name): Unescape further in titles.
	(emacs-wiki-make-link): Escape # in titles.

	The files I touched compile cleanly under Emacs CVS and XEmacs,
	with the exception of emacs-wiki.el. I still have to untangle it.
	Again, apologies for small, careless bugs. Would love to hear from
	anyone with more experience writing test suites for Emacs
	programs! Also, have to get the hang of testcover.el ... =)

     	* planner-rmail.el (rmail): Add missing require.

	* planner.el (planner-create-task-from-info): Fix free variable.
