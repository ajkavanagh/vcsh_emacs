New variable: planner-hide-task-status-when-highlighting

Martin Morgan suggested highlighting only a small part of the task, as
wide seas of red can be quite overwhelming. Tried it out and thought
it was a cool idea, so this version highlights only the
category/priority with the category color and now properly does the
completed/in-progress/delegated task highlighting. Martin sent a
patch, too, which made the status invisible, but I like seeing the
status so that I can change it by hand. New variable
planner-hide-task-status-when-highlighting controls this.
