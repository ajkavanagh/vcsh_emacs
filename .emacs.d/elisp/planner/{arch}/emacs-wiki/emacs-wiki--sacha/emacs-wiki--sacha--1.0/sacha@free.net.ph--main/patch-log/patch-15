Summary: planner-tasks-tag
Keywords: 

<tasks> is a new emacs-wiki tag. When published to HTML, this is
replaced by a list of all the tasks. You can control the status by
specifying a regular expression to match. For example,
<tasks status="X"> will list all completed tasks, while
<tasks status="[^X]"> will list all incomplete tasks.
This is handled by the planner-task--tag function.

<tasks> is part of the planner-markup-tags list. 

planner-list-tasks-with-status now takes a regular expression for
STATUS.

planner-list-unfinished-tasks uses the modified
planner-list-tasks-with-status.
