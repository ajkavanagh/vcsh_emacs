	* planner-el.texi (Installing from a Source Archive): Mention
	creating an ~/elisp directory.  Also mention how to get Muse and
	Remember.  Mention running "make clean".
	(Installing from Arch): Document Remember archive usage.  Use "tla
	update", not "tla replay".
	(Installing from Debian): Mention remember-el.  Since I get asked
	this so frequently, mention how to make the warning message go
	away -- it's not an error!
	(Timeclock): Shift xref to end of sentence so makeinfo doesn't
	complain.
	(Getting Help): Change URL to the emacswiki.org one.  So long,
	plannerlove.  Thanks to Hadron Quark for pointing all this out.
