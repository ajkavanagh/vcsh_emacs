Summary: Tasks with deadlines will be moved properly from previous days.
Keywords: 

* planner-deadline.el: Whitespace munging.  Make sure
 planner-deadline-update to planner-goto-hook -- it's a sure thing that
 this behavior will be desired if you have deadlines!
 (planner-deadline-change-hook): Add planner-deadline-update as the
 default value.

* planner.el (planner-copy-or-move-region): Optimize.  Only move upwards
  if no tasks exists at this line, or if we encounter an error.  This
  should prevent planner from playing Russian Roulette with tasks from
  previous days, such as deadlines.
  (plan): Use point-min and point-max for the sake of clarity.
