Also (didn't show up previously, for some reason):

patch 6:  planner-multi-replan-task: Links weren't being added to new
          pages: the test (member (planner-page-name) ...) should be
          (member (planner-page-name page) ...).

patch 7:  planner-make-link advice: Use planner-multi-make-link instead
          of muse-make-link to avoid extra bracketing.

patch 8:  planner-multi-task-delete-this-page: Pages to delete weren't
          being removed from the link list correctly; double and
          single links weren't dealt with correctly.

patch 9:  planner-multi-task-delete-this-page: An improvement on patch
          8: use planner-multi-replan-task

patch 10: planner-multi-task-xref: the date page ended up appearing
          twice in the link list.
