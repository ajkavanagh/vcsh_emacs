Summary: Make generated Debian packages slightly easier to upload.
Keywords: 

* debian/changelog: Generate 3.30.arch.52-1.

* debian/control (Description): Clarify that this a port of Planner.

* debian/rules (clean): Call $(MAKE) realclean instead of $(MAKE) clean.

* Makefile.defs (LASTUPLOAD): New variable that indicates the version
  that was last uploaded to Debian.

* Makefile (debrelease): Use $(LASTUPLOAD) to ensure that a full set of
  changes is generated.  This means we have to use dpkg-buildpackage,
  since debuild doesn't recognize the environment variables that it
  claims to recognize.
