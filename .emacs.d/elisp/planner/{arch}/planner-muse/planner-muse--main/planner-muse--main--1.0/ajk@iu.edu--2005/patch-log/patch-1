Summary: Muse port and related improvements
Keywords: 

 - port to Muse

 - mark up planner's <note> and <task> tags instead of using markup
   regexps

 - should now be easier to support other templating systems than Mason by
   defining new styles and changing planner-authz-after-publish-hook

 - allow the regexp used to control access to sections to be customized
   (planner-authz-sections-regexp)

 - optionally control access to published diary entries (suggested by Jim
   Ottaway)

 - build per-page access control lists on demand instead of all at once
   at the beginning -- should be more efficient because we'll rarely need
   a full list

 - use :strings to avoid contortions when inserting Mason tags

 - instead of automatically generating an index, Muse seems to prefer
   that users add the index to pages using <lisp> tags, so instead of
   overloading Muse's index-generating functions, simply provide
   planner-authz-index-as-string

 - while looping through planner-authz-pages-to-republish, actually pop
   off the entries to avoid republishing the same page twice if the
   process gets interrupted

 - run planner-authz-markup-sections on the whole buffer before
   planner.el gets a chance to convert everything into XML-like tags (I'd
   rather work with the <section> tags, but Muse needs support for nested
   tags of the same name)
